# Animals Image Classification

An animal classification web application involve creating a web-based application that can classify animals based on user-provided input, such as an image or video of the animal.

The following steps can be taken to create such an application:

1. Collect and prepare the data: The first step would be to collect a dataset of images and videos of different animals, along with their labels. This data would then      need to be split into a training set and a test set.

2. Build the model: Next, a machine learning model would need to be trained on the training data to learn how to classify animals. This could involve using a              convolutional neural network (CNN) or another type of deep learning model. I had used vgg-19 here.

3. Deploy the model: Once the model has been trained and tested, it would need to be deployed as a web service so that it can be accessed by the web application. This      could be done using a platform like TensorFlow Serving, which allows for easy deployment of trained models.

4. Create the web application: Next, the web application would need to be created. This would involve building the user interface and connecting it to the deployed        model. The application would need to be able to accept user input (an image or video) and send it to the model for classification.

5. Deploy the application: Finally, the web application would need to be deployed to a web server so that it can be accessed by users. This could be done using a          platform like Heroku or Google App Engine.

It's worth noting that the complexity of this project would vary depending on the desired features of the application, such as the number of animals to classify, the type of user input, the level of accuracy, and the number of users that will use it.
